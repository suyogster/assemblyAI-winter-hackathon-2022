Once upon a time, there was a poor boy called Jack. He lived in a small village and was struggling to make ends meet. One day, while Jack was walking in the woods, he encountered an old man who seemed to be lost. The old man asked Jack for help to find his way back home. Jack, without hesitation, agreed to help him. 

The old man was grateful and offered Jack a reward in return. The old man gave Jack a box full of jewels and gold coins. Jack gratefully accepted the gift and thanked the old man. 

Jack used the box of riches to start his own business and become a successful businessman. He was no longer poor and was able to provide for his family. Jack never forgot the kindness of the old man and visits him every year to thank him. 

The journey of the poor boy Jack who helped an unknown old man, ended with him becoming a rich and successful businessman.
